## Project Overview
**Author:** Ronn Martin (ronn.martin@veeam.com), Mark Polin (mark.polin@veeam.com)

**Description:** This repository contains sample Powershell-based workflows designed for use with Cisco Intersight Orchestration and Veeam Backup & Replication v11+.

Cisco Intersight Orchestration simplifies orchestration and automation for infrastructure and workloads across hybrid cloud by providing an easy-to-use workflow designer. Based on a library of multi-domain tasks (custom or provided by Cisco), it enables users to create workflows, quickly and easily.  This enables automation and deployment of any infrastructure resource, including servers, VMs, networks and applications.  Customer‚Äôs benefit from Intersight Orchestration by reducing the complexity of managing their hybrid IT environment.

## üìó Project Notes

Prerequisites: 
* Veeam Backup & Replication (VBR) server instance(s), v11+
* Cisco Intersight Assist - on-premises Cisco server which enables visibility of datacenter endpoint devices for the Cisco Intersight Orchestration service. Cisco Intersight Assist is available as a virtual appliance (OVA) for installation on VMware ESXi. For more information, see the [Cisco Intersight Virtual Appliance Getting Started Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/Intersight/cisco-intersight-assist-getting-started-guide/m-overview-of-cisco-intersight-assist.html). Virtual appliance installation steps can be found at [Installing Cisco Intersight using VMware vSphere Web Client](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/Intersight/cisco-intersight-assist-getting-started-guide/m-installing-cisco-intersight-assist.html) DO NOT ignore the DNS setup steps.

Setup: 
* Once Cisco Intersight Assist has been deployed and configured it can be by claimed by the Intersight cloud service per the procedure documented at - [Target Claim for Compute/Fabric, Hyperconverged, Orchestrator, and Platform Services Targets](https://www.intersight.com/help/saas/getting_started/claim_targets#minimum_permissions_for_targets).  
* Next, VBR server(s) need to be "claimed" as authorized targets for PowerShell "executor" orchestration access. Prepare the target VBR instance(s) by copying and executing the PowerShell script located at [Executors - Invoke PowerShell Script](https://intersight.com/help/saas/resources/Executor_PowerShell#supported_targets) to grant the necessary WinRM remoting permissions. 
* VBR server(s) can then be claimed via the procedure outlined at [Target Claim Using Intersight Assist](https://intersight.com/help/saas/getting_started/claim_targets#target_claim_using_intersight_assist)
* Sample workflows are located in the "Sample Workflows" folder of this repository and should be downloaded and imported via the Intersight web console.  Note that orchestration workflow tasks are embedded in the workflows and will also populate new Intersight tasks concurrent with the workflow import. Two workflows are provided for reference -
  * **VBR - Deploy Agents:** Takes inputs of target VBR server, IP addresses or DNS names for agent targets, agent target credentials (one set), OS platform (Windows or Linux), protection group name, protection group description, backup job name and VBR repository name.  This workflow checks for the existence of the agent credentials in the VBR database and adds them if they do not exist, next creates the protection group and adds the specified agent targets and finally creates a backup job for the protection group.
  * **VBR - Deploy Proxy:** Takes inputs of target VBR server, IP address or DNS name for targeted proxy host, target proxy host credentials, OS platform (Windows or Linux) and the proxy type to deploy (VMware, Hyper-V, CDP, NAS, etc.).  This workflow checks for the existence of the agent crendentials in the VBR database and adds them if they do not exist, adds the targeted host as a VBR managed server and finally assigns the appropriate proxy role to the server.

Operation:
* The sample workflows should operate correctly without modification but of course only address two narrow use cases.  The orchestration tasks which are populated with the workflow import can be freely modified or new tasks may of course be created. For purposes of illustration, to extend the "VBR Add Managed Server v1.0" task to also allow vCenter host additions the "VBR - Add Managed Server v1.0" task attached Powershell script could be updated from -
  * ```
            Switch ({{.global.task.input.hostplatform}}) {
                0 {
                    Write-Output "Adding windows host"
                    Add-VBRWinServer -Name "{{.global.task.input.servername}}" -Credentials $cred
                    }
                1 {        
                    Write-Output "Adding linux host"
                    Add-VBRLinux -Name "{{.global.task.input.servername}}" -Credentials $cred -confirm:$False
                    }
            }
  ```

* to -

   * ```
            Switch ({{.global.task.input.hostplatform}}) {
                0 {
                    Write-Output "Adding windows host"
                    Add-VBRWinServer -Name "{{.global.task.input.servername}}" -Credentials $cred
                    }
                1 {        
                    Write-Output "Adding linux host"
                    Add-VBRLinux -Name "{{.global.task.input.servername}}" -Credentials $cred -confirm:$False
                    }
                2 {        
                    Write-Output "Adding VMware host"
                    Add-VBRvCenter -Name "{{.global.task.input.servername}}" -Credentials $cred
                    }
            }
  ```
Via selecting the Powershell executor task step, properties, inputs and script -

Next since an enumeration type is defined for the managed server OS platform in our example the task properties must be extended to include the new vCenter type matching the modiefied Powershell script via -

Select the edit icon for the "Host Platform" input and add an entry for vCenter-
