## Project Overview
**Author:** Ronn Martin (ronn.martin@veeam.com), Mark Polin (mark.polin@veeam.com)

**Description:** This repository contains sample Powershell-based workflows designed for use with Cisco Intersight Orchestration and Veeam Backup & Replication v11+.

Cisco Intersight Orchestration simplifies orchestration and automation for infrastructure and workloads across hybrid cloud by providing an easy-to-use workflow designer. Based on a library of multi-domain tasks (custom or provided by Cisco), it enables users to create workflows, quickly and easily.  This enables automation and deployment of any infrastructure resource, including servers, VMs, networks and applications.  Customer‚Äôs benefit from Intersight Orchestration by reducing the complexity of managing their hybrid IT environment.

## üìó Project Notes

Prerequisites: 
* Veeam Backup & Replication (VBR) server instance(s), v11+
* Cisco Intersight Assist - on-premises server instance which enables visibility of datacenter endpoint devices for the Cisco Intersight Orchestration service. Cisco Intersight Assist is available as a virtual appliance (OVA) for installation on VMware ESXi. For more information, see the [Cisco Intersight Virtual Appliance Getting Started Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/Intersight/cisco-intersight-assist-getting-started-guide/m-overview-of-cisco-intersight-assist.html). Virtual appliance installation steps can be found at [Installing Cisco Intersight using VMware vSphere Web Client](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/Intersight/cisco-intersight-assist-getting-started-guide/m-installing-cisco-intersight-assist.html)

Setup: 
* Once Cisco Intersight Assist has been deployed and configured it can be claimed per the procedure documented at - [Target Claim for Compute/Fabric, Hyperconverged, Orchestrator, and Platform Services Targets](https://www.intersight.com/help/saas/getting_started/claim_targets#minimum_permissions_for_targets)into the Intersight cloud service.  
* Next, VBR server(s) need to be "claimed" as authorized targets for PowerShell "executor" orchestration access. Prepare the target VBR instance(s) by copying and executing the PowerShell script located at [Executors - Invoke PowerShell Script](https://intersight.com/help/saas/resources/Executor_PowerShell#supported_targets) to grant the necessary WinRM remoting permissions. 
* VBR server(s) can then be claimed via the procedure outlined at [Target Claim Using Intersight Assist](https://intersight.com/help/saas/getting_started/claim_targets#target_claim_using_intersight_assist
* Sample workflows are located in the "Workflows" folder of this repository and should be downloaded and imported via the Intersight console.  Note that orchestration workflow tasks are embedded in the workflows and will also populate new Intersight tasks concurrent with the workflow import.


Operation:
* Creating custom tasks - samples provide a template
* Creating custom workflows - if creating custom workflows from sample task be sure to match expected reference names i.e.
