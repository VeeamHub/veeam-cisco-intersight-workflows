## Project Overview
**Author:** Ronn Martin (ronn.martin@veeam.com)

**Description:** This repository contains sample Powershell-based workflows designed for use with Cisco Intersight Orchestrator and Veeam Backup & Replication v11+.

Cisco Intersight Cloud Orchestrator simplifies orchestration and automation for infrastructure and workloads across hybrid cloud by providing an easy-to-use workflow designer. Based on a library of multi-domain tasks (custom or provided by Cisco), it enables users to create workflows, quickly and easily.  This enables automation and deployment of any infrastructure resource, including servers, VMs, networks and applications.  Customer‚Äôs benefit from Intersight Cloud Orchestrator by reducing the complexity of managing their hybrid IT environment.

## üìó Project Notes

Prerequisites: Cisco Intersight Assist - on-premises server instance which enables visibility of datacenter endpoint devices for the Cisco Intersight Orchestrator service. Cisco Intersight Assist is available as a virtual appliance (OVA) for installation on VMware ESXi. For more information, see the [Cisco Intersight Virtual Appliance Getting Started Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/Intersight/cisco-intersight-assist-getting-started-guide/m-overview-of-cisco-intersight-assist.html). Virtual appliance installation steps can be found at [Installing Cisco Intersight using VMware vSphere Web Client](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/Intersight/cisco-intersight-assist-getting-started-guide/m-installing-cisco-intersight-assist.html)

After claiming Intersight Assist into Intersight, you can claim endpoint devices
